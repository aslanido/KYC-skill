| Level | Role | Date | Decision | Rationale |

## LESSONS LEARNED / BEST PRACTICES

### Micro Entity Assessment Best Practices

This case demonstrates effective assessment of UK micro entities:

1. **Accept Limited Disclosure**:
   - Micro entities legally file simplified accounts
   - Limited financial data is normal and acceptable
   - Focus on: operating history, compliance record, screening results
   - Don't penalize for lack of detailed revenue figures

2. **Companies House Verification**:
   - Official registry provides core verification
   - Filing compliance demonstrates legitimacy
   - 11-year history indicates ongoing viability
   - Director stability (same since inception) positive indicator

3. **Risk-Based Approach**:
   - Clean screening results (0/100) most important factor
   - Low-risk jurisdiction (UK) provides regulatory comfort
   - Standard business sector (consultancy) acceptable
   - Overall LOW risk despite limited transparency

4. **Appropriate Mitigation**:
   - Request additional documentation (business overview)
   - Enhanced monitoring first 6 months
   - Annual review to reassess
   - Transaction monitoring for unusual patterns

### Small Business Customer Success Factors

**What Worked**:
- ✅ Accepted micro entity limitations (not requiring full financials)
- ✅ Relied on Companies House as primary verification source
- ✅ Comprehensive screening despite limited information
- ✅ Risk-based decision (LOW score = standard onboarding)
- ✅ Requested supplementary information without rejection
- ✅ Planned enhanced monitoring to validate assumptions

**Key Considerations for Similar Cases**:
- **Operating history matters**: 11 years > detailed financials for micro entities
- **Compliance record critical**: No violations > extensive disclosure
- **Screening is paramount**: Clean sanctions/PEP/adverse = strongest indicator
- **Document what you know**: Single director, address, activities
- **Monitor what you don't**: Transaction patterns, business evolution
- **Review regularly**: Annual reassessment with updated information

### Red Flags NOT Present (Positive Indicators)

Contrast with shell companies/high-risk entities:

| Factor | Shell Company ❌ | ARIA ASSOCIATES ✅ |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Operating History** | Recently formed (<1 year) | 11 years established |
| **Filing Compliance** | Overdue/missing | Current and compliant |
| **Director Stability** | Frequent changes | Same since 2014 |
| **Screening** | Sanctions/adverse hits | Clean across all lists |
| **Business Evidence** | Zero footprint | Registered activities, consultancy sector |
| **Address** | Mail drop/secretarial | Residential/office address |

**Conclusion**: ARIA ASSOCIATES exhibits characteristics of legitimate small UK consultancy, not shell company or high-risk entity.

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### ARIA ASSOCIATES vs. Recent Cases

| Factor | ARIA ASSOCIATES ✅ | Quantexa Limited ✅ | Norway Ogarsen ❌ | UAB EM SYSTEM ❌ |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Company Age** | 11 years (2014) | 9 years (2016) | <1 year active | 5 years |
| **Size** | Micro entity | Unicorn (£76M revenue) | Unknown | €413K revenue |
| **Beneficial Ownership** | Single director (verified) | Verified institutional | Cannot verify | Sanctioned owner (50%) |
| **Accounts Filed** | ✅ Current | ✅ Current | ❌ Overdue | ✅ Filed but frozen |
| **Online Presence** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Extensive | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Employees** | <10 (micro) | 300+ verified | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Screening** | ✅ Clean | ✅ Clean | ✅ Clean entity | ❌ UBO sanctioned |
| **Business Evidence** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Verified clients | ❌ Zero | ❌ Zero |
| **Risk Score** | 28/100 (LOW) | 18/100 (LOW) | 85/100 (PROHIBITED) | 100/100 (PROHIBITED) |
| **Decision** | **APPROVED** | **APPROVED** | **REJECTED** | **REJECTED** |

**Key Takeaway**:
- **Size doesn't determine legitimacy**: Micro entities can be legitimate (ARIA ASSOCIATES) just as large ones (Quantexa)
- **Screening + Compliance > Transparency**: Clean screening and 11-year compliance record outweigh limited disclosure
- **Operating history matters**: Established track record indicates legitimacy even with minimal online presence
- **Red flags are decisive**: Sanctions (UAB), missing accounts (Norway Ogarsen) = automatic rejection

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### How We're Managing Limited Transparency

**Challenge**: Micro entity with limited financial disclosure and minimal online presence

**Mitigation Approach**:

1. **Additional Documentation** (requested within 30 days):
   - Business overview to understand operations
   - Expected turnover to establish baseline
   - Source of funds verification for initial deposit
   → Supplements micro entity limited disclosure

2. **Enhanced Monitoring** (first 6 months):
   - Monthly transaction review (vs. quarterly standard)
   - Verify patterns align with consultancy business
   - Alert on unusual transactions (>£50K, high-risk jurisdictions, cash)
   → Validates assumptions about business activities

3. **Regular Review Cycle**:
   - Annual KYC refresh (vs. 2-3 years for very low risk)
   - Quarterly Companies House compliance checks
   - Quarterly media/sanctions screening
   → Ensures ongoing vigilance despite initial approval

4. **Succession Planning Consideration**:
   - Director is 83 years old (succession risk)
   - Annual review includes business continuity discussion
   - Monitor for new director appointments
   → Manages concentration risk of single elderly director

5. **Transaction Monitoring Focus**:
   - Cash deposits (unusual for consultancy)
   - Third-party payments (not direct client/vendor)
   - High-risk jurisdiction exposure
   - Rapid in-and-out fund movements
   → Detects potential misuse despite limited upfront information

**Expected Outcome**:
- First 6 months: Validate business operates as stated
- If patterns consistent: Continue standard monitoring
- If inconsistencies: Escalate for enhanced due diligence or exit
- Annual reviews: Update risk assessment with new information
