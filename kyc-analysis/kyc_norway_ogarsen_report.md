# KYC Due Diligence Report

**Entity:** Norway Ogarsen International Biotechnology Co., Limited  
**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Analyst:** Claude (KYC Analysis Skill)  
**Report Type:** Enhanced Due Diligence

---

## Executive Summary

🔴 **HIGH RISK.** Classic shell company indicators. UK-registered "dormant" company with "Norway" in the name but zero connection to Norway. 100% owned and controlled by a Chinese national residing in China. No business operations, no website, no employees, no revenue. Uses virtual office address shared with dozens of other companies. **Critical: This is the SECOND iteration. A nearly identical company with the same director was incorporated in 2020 and dissolved in 2021.** Pattern suggests entity may exist solely for name/legitimacy purposes rather than genuine commercial activity.

**Risk Rating: HIGH (75/100)**  
**Recommendation: DECLINE relationship. Request detailed business rationale if customer insists.**

## Business Activity Analysis

### Stated Business

**SIC Code 99999**: "Dormant company, no significant accounting transactions"

This is explicitly not a trading company. It has:
- ❌ No revenue
- ❌ No employees
- ❌ No transactions
- ❌ No products or services
- ❌ No website or marketing
- ❌ No physical operations

### Name vs. Reality

| Element | Claim | Reality |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "Norway" | Implies Norwegian connection | Zero connection to Norway. UK-registered, China-controlled. |
| "International" | Implies global operations | No operations anywhere |
| "Biotechnology" | Implies biotech business | No biotech activity, no R&D, no products |
| "Co., Limited" | Legitimate company structure | Shell company with no substance |

**Assessment:** Company name is materially misleading. This appears designed to create false impression of Nordic/European legitimacy for a dormant shell.

## Red Flags 🚩

### Critical Flags

| # | Flag | Severity | Details |
|---|------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Serial Incorporation Pattern** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Predecessor company (12498694) incorporated March 2020, dissolved September 2021. Same director. Same dormant status. Same misleading name. Current company incorporated May 2023. Why dissolve and recreate? |
| 2 | **No Legitimate Business Purpose** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 2+ years of existence with zero commercial activity. What is this entity for? |
| 3 | **Misleading Name** | 🔴 HIGH | "Norway" has no connection to company. Geographic naming for entities with no actual presence is a known shell company red flag. |
| 4 | **Virtual Office Address** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Shared address with many unrelated companies. No physical presence. |
| 5 | **Foreign Control, No Local Nexus** | 🟡 MEDIUM | 100% China-controlled with no UK-resident personnel. Why incorporate in UK? |
| 6 | **Information Opacity** | 🟡 MEDIUM | No website, no contact info, no public footprint. Cannot independently verify anything about this entity. |

### Pattern Analysis

The combination of:
- Misleading geographic name ("Norway")
- Impressive-sounding industry ("Biotechnology")
- Prestigious jurisdiction (UK) 
- Foreign UBO with no local presence
- Zero actual business activity
- Prior dissolved entity with identical characteristics

...is a textbook **shell company** profile. Common uses for such entities include:
- Invoice fraud / trade-based money laundering
- Layering in complex ownership structures
- Fake supplier/vendor schemes
- Identity lending for sanctions evasion

**No evidence of criminal activity found**, but the structure has no apparent legitimate purpose.

---

## Jurisdictional Risk

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Incorporation Jurisdiction (UK)** | LOW risk - Strong AML regime |
| **UBO Residence (China)** | MEDIUM risk - Limited transparency, difficult to verify |
| **"Norway" Name Association** | N/A - No actual Norway connection |
| **FATF Status** | UK: Compliant. China: Compliant with concerns. |

---

## Financial Profile

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| **Revenue** | £0 (dormant) |
| **Assets** | Not disclosed |
| **Liabilities** | Not disclosed |
| **Last Accounts** | Dormant accounts filed May 31, 2025 |
| **Audit** | Not required (dormant) |

**Assessment:** No financial activity to assess. Entity exists in name only.

## Risk Scoring

| Category | Weight | Score | Weighted |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Ownership Transparency | 20% | 70 | 14 |
| Business Legitimacy | 25% | 90 | 22.5 |
| Jurisdictional Risk | 15% | 40 | 6 |
| Principal Background | 20% | 50 | 10 |
| Red Flag Severity | 20% | 85 | 17 |
| **TOTAL** | 100% | - | **69.5** |

**Adjustment:** +5 for serial incorporation pattern (prior dissolved entity)

**Final Score: 75/100 = HIGH RISK**

---

## Information Gaps

The following could not be verified from public sources:

1. ☐ Actual business purpose / commercial rationale for entity
2. ☐ Source of funds for any future transactions
3. ☐ Reason for dissolution of predecessor company
4. ☐ Why "Norway" is in the company name
5. ☐ Criminal/civil records for UBO in China
6. ☐ Any legitimate business activity anywhere
7. ☐ Relationship (if any) to actual biotechnology operations

---

## Conclusion & Recommendation

### Risk Rating: 🔴 HIGH

This entity exhibits classic shell company characteristics:
- Impressive name with no substance behind it
- Serial incorporation with same dormant pattern
- Foreign control with no local presence
- No business activity whatsoever
- Materially misleading name

### Recommendation

**DECLINE** the relationship absent compelling evidence of legitimate commercial purpose.

If customer insists on proceeding, require at minimum:
1. Written explanation of why company was dissolved and recreated
2. Detailed business plan with verifiable milestones
3. Explanation of "Norway" in company name
4. Source of funds for any transactions
5. In-person meeting with UBO (Mr. Tang) or authorized representative
6. Enhanced transaction monitoring if onboarded
7. 90-day review of any account activity
