---

## Information Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Detailed financials | Low. Micro entity exemption is legal. |
| Client list/references | Low. Common for small consultancies. |
| Website/marketing | Low. B2B firms often have minimal presence. |
| Director background detail | Low. UK national, long tenure, clean screening. |

No gaps rise to level of concern given clean screening and 11-year compliance record.

---

## Conclusion

**Aria Associates Limited** is a legitimate small UK consultancy. The company has operated for 11 years with clean regulatory compliance and zero adverse findings across sanctions, PEP, and media screening. Limited public information is consistent with micro-entity status and small B2B operations.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with standard onboarding. Consider requesting brief business overview to supplement limited public disclosure.
